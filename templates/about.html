	<h2 align="center"> ABOUT MY MOVIE RECOMMENDER </h2>
	<h4 align="center"> BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT:</h4>
	<p>
The dataset used for building this recommender system was gotten from 
<a href='https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/'> GroupLens </a>
They are a team of researchers from the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>
The idea behind this system is that movies of similar ratings would hold similar interests for viewers. 
Basically you’re more likely to be interested in a movie if it rates similar to a movie you really enjoy. This has actually proven to be true in a general sense.
</p>

<h4>CHALLENGES:</h4>
<p>
As expected, wrangling the data was the biggest challenge faced. 
A borrowed concept of weighted scoring was used. Credit to IMDB. 
The idea behind weighted scoring is to ensure that if a movie is rated 6.0 by a thousand people, it is weighted heavier than a movie that’s rated 6.0 by ten people only. This is crucial to the effectiveness of this system.
The new scoring system was developed into a new feature and used as my target vector.
The movie genres were stored as JSON objects. As a result I had to utilize regEx functions to extract them from these objects. Each movie had a combination of several genres and resulted in me having to manually One-Hot-Encode them into my dataset.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of this project, I have only made three models available to be tested in developing your movie recommendations. I have also provided (hopefully) some residual plots showing how well these models perform on the validation data sets before going on to make predictions.
</p>
<p>Despite having laid out the project such that your already-wrangled data is available </p>
, the code contains all that you need to do the wrangling yourself. 

Storing of the completely trained models and data pipelines were achieved using the python pickle library. All pre-trained models are re-called in the app.py file prior to deployment of the web app.

<p>
I thoroughly enjoyed working on this and hopefully it serves as a platform for more work:
<h4>FURTHER POSSIBILITIES:</h4>
<p>
- Utilization of Cosine-Similarities to link movies with their summaries.
- Inclusion of production crew and cast in the movie ranking metrics
